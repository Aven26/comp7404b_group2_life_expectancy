COMP7404B Group project(Group 2). Regional Life Expectancy Regression with Machine Learning

There are factors to the average life expectancy of a population, such as wealth, immunization, and education. We aim to discover the most significant factors and make predictions on the average life expectancy. Various machine learning techniques, like random forest and neural network regression, will be used to build the regression model and make predictions. Non-machine learning models would be used as a benchmark. Statistics Training datasets are openly available on WHO website and kaggle.com.
